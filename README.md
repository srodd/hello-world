# hello-world
testing and getting started...

I am a former db and java coder who is way out of practice, but I am interested in earning my MCSA and spacialist certifications for MS Azure and becoming an Azure Solutions Architect or pursuing a career in sales. My background is in manufacturing capability improvement and business systems development and administration.
